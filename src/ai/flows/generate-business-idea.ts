  A user has provided their interests. Your task is to generate 3 unique, practical, and logical business ideas that are DIRECTLY related to what the user has specified.

  IMPORTANT: The ideas must be realistic and directly connected to the user's interests. For example, if the user says they love animals, you MUST suggest animal-related businesses (like a dog walking service or pet grooming) and you MUST NOT suggest unrelated businesses (like a home baking business or a tech startup).

  User Interests: {{{interests}}}

  For each idea, provide a clear title, a description of the business, and a few actionable first steps.
