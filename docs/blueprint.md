## Core Features:

- Novel Co-writer: Collaborate with AI to write novels, offering suggestions, plot twists, and character development assistance. The AI emulates human-like writing styles.
- Business Form Creator: Generate customized business forms (e.g., invoices, contracts) with AI, remembering user's business information for quick population or allowing creation of new forms for different entities.
- Fine-Print Summarizer: Use AI to summarize complex documents, highlighting key terms and conditions in an easy-to-understand format.
- Human-Like Letter Writer: Craft personalized letters using AI that mimics human writing styles, avoiding the typical 'AI' sound. Users can specify tone and purpose.
- SME Course Designer: Allows Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to upload existing files, documents, recorded lectures, or company manuals, which the AI analyzes to establish the course foundation.
- AI-Powered Course Outline Generation: Generates an initial course outline based on the uploaded SME content and user-defined parameters (e.g., number of modules, target audience).
- AI Editing Suite: Provides an interface with AI-powered editing tools for refining course content. Users can shorten content, generate quiz questions, and rewrite paragraphs in different styles by instructing a tool. The tool uses an LLM to conditionally transform information to incorporate into its response to fulfill a user request.

- Grounded Content with RAG: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to cite specific web pages or documents used to write the factual content.
- LMS Export: Enables exporting the final course in formats directly usable by Learning Management Systems (LMS) like SCORM or HTML5.
- Memoir Revision Loops: Allows users to iteratively refine AI-generated prose by providing feedback on specific sections and prompting the AI to make targeted revisions, ensuring the output aligns with their emotional reality. The tool uses an LLM to conditionally transform information to incorporate into its response to fulfill a user request.
